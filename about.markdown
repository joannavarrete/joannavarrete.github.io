I try to live by two principles

1. Treat others how you want to be treated.
2. Be proud of what you do. 

Since I started working I have been a plumber, a programmer, a permaculturist, a farmer, a beekeeper, a father and again a programmer.

I have done my best in every task I have undertaken and that, mixed with such a broad range of disciplines, gives me an interdisciplinary perspective.

I will write about different themes but mostly about programming. 

I hope you enjoy it.
